# Overview
RuleCMS UI Mock Creator is a tool to easily create responsive UI mockups. It has a drag-and-drop interface featuring a collection of hand-drawn style UI elements. It's perfect for building wireframes, mockups, or enjoying the fun, sketch-like design.

The building blocks are arranged using css flexbox, creating a responsive layout. This makes this interface stand out against a lot of drag and drop tools that use a fixed layout and have to moved around pixel by pixel. They also do not adjust based on the browser's screen resolution.

# Running Locally

✨ **This workspace has been generated by [Nx, Smart Monorepos · Fast CI.](https://nx.dev)** ✨

## Integrate with editors


## Start the application

Run `npx nx serve flexbox-based-ui-composer-app` to start the development server. Happy coding!

## Build for production

Run `npx nx build flexbox-based-ui-composer-app` to build the application. The build artifacts are stored in the output directory (e.g. `dist/` or `build/`), ready to be deployed.

## Running tasks

To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax:

```
npx nx <target> <project> <...options>
```

You can also run multiple targets:

```
npx nx run-many -t <target1> <target2>
```

..or add `-p` to filter specific projects

```
npx nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>
```

Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json`. Learn more [in the docs](https://nx.dev/features/run-tasks).
